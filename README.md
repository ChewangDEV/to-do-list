📋 Display tasks with index numbers

❌ Delete tasks by index

🧠 Input validation (prevents empty tasks)

🔄 Dynamic UI updates without page refresh

🖱️ Event-driven functionality (no blocking loops)

🛠 Technologies Used

HTML5

CSS3

JavaScript (Vanilla JS)

DOM Manipulation

Event Listeners

📚 What I Learned

While building this project, I practiced:

Working with arrays (push, splice)

Looping through arrays (for, for...of)

Handling user input

Keyboard event handling (keydown, Enter key support)

Creating reusable functions

Rendering dynamic content in the DOM

Managing application state

Writing clean control flow logic

Debugging and handling edge cases

🧩 How It Works

User enters a task in the input field.

Task is stored in an array.

The list is dynamically rendered using JavaScript.

Each task includes a delete option.

UI updates instantly after every action.

🎯 Purpose of This Project

This project was built to strengthen foundational JavaScript concepts before moving into advanced topics like:

Local Storage

Object-based state management

Advanced DOM interactions

Frameworks (React, etc.)

💡 Future Improvements

Save tasks using localStorage

Add task completion (mark as done)

Add edit functionality

Add dark mode

Improve UI animations
